fix: resolve multiple critical issues in Next.js portfolio

- Fix theme hydration issue with custom ThemeProvider component
- Resolve module resolution errors by standardizing import paths
- Fix "Prop className did not match" errors in theme toggle
- Downgrade Next.js from v15.3.3 to v14.1.0 for compatibility
- Restore missing Contact.tsx component 
- Remove duplicate configuration files (postcss.config.mjs)
- Clean webpack cache warnings for PostCSS configuration
- Update personalInfo with correct contact information

This commit addresses multiple issues that were causing the portfolio site to crash 
or display incorrectly. The theme system now works correctly with proper server/client 
hydration, and all components now render properly without hydration mismatches.
