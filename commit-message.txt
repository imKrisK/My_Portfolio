feat: enhance resume functionality with interactive HTML view

- Created dedicated HTML resume page at /resume/dedicated with tabbed interface
- Updated personalInfo.ts to use "Kristoffer Kelly - CV.pdf" instead of "Kristoffer_Kelly_Resume.pdf"
- Added cross-navigation between PDF and HTML resume views
- Enhanced Navbar with dropdown menu for resume options
- Fixed PDF loading with better client-side detection and error handling
- Added fallback UI for cases when PDF cannot be loaded
- Updated package.json with scripts for resume management:
  - setup-resume: Copies PDF files to public directory
  - update-resume-info: Updates resume data automatically
  - check-pdfs: Verifies PDF files exist in correct locations
- Enhanced documentation with comprehensive RESUME_IMPLEMENTATION.md

This commit significantly improves the resume experience by offering visitors both 
a PDF version and an interactive HTML version with detailed sections for experience, 
education, and skills. The implementation ensures proper file management, error handling, 
and consistent data between both views.
