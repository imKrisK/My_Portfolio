# Profile Images

This directory contains your personal profile images used throughout the portfolio.

## Current Profile Image

- `profile-pic.jpg` - Main profile image used in the Hero component

## Guidelines for Profile Images

- **Resolution**: Use high-resolution images (at least 600x600 pixels)
- **Format**: JPEG format works best for photographs
- **Cropping**: Square or 1:1 aspect ratio works best for profile images
- **Style**: Professional headshot or portrait-style photos work best
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB for optimal loading performance

## Updating Your Profile Image

If you want to replace your profile image:

1. Name your new image `profile-pic.jpg` and place it in this directory
2. OR update the `src` attribute in the Hero component (`src/components/Hero.tsx`) to point to your new image
3. If your image has different dimensions or aspect ratio, you might need to adjust the CSS styling

## Backup

The original image is also stored at `/public/images/projects/imKrisK.JPEG`
